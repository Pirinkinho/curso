1. TDD: fizzBuzz
Your task is to write a function, fizzBuzz, that accepts a number and returns a string:

'fizz' if the number is divisible by 3;
'buzz' if the number is divisible by 5;
'fizzbuzz' if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
'{number}' if the number doesn't fulfil any of the above conditions.
As you create the function in fizzbuzz.js, you should also write tests in index.test.js. You'll need to create your own test cases as you go.

Edge cases to consider:

what should fizzbuzz(0) return?
what should happen if the function is passed a string?
2. Mocking functions: mapWithCb
The mapwithCb function accepts an array and a callback. It maps over the array with the callback, so we can expect the callback function to be called multiple times.

Your task is to write tests for mapWithCb, which will involve writing a mock function (aka a spy) for the callback function. The test cases have been provided for you.
